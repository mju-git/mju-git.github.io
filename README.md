## Classification

[Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/mju-git/Music-Genre-Classification)

Classifying audio files in genres they belong to based on extracted audio data. Using GTZAN dataset with 1000 files divides in 10 music genres. Testing on variety of classification algorithms. Achieved 91% accuracy with CatBoostClassifier. Extracting audio data and creating visualizations as a base for deep learning model. Next steps include music recommender system based on detailed audio data.
